This is a learning project, I am teaching myself redux, and react-router.  I aslo intend on adding RxJS at somepoint down the road

it is the partner project for ladderAPI, the backend written with Express.js

Ladder Client is the front end of a app that will track gaming tournamnt ladder competitions between stores.  It is meant for Age of Sigmar, but will be able to be used to create a ladder for any head to head competitive strategy game
